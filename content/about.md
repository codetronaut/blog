I am currently in the penultimate year of my Engineering and pursuing Computer Science with a Major in Information Technology. I am a Kernel and Operating Systems enthusiast and exploring low abstraction excites me. Currently working on Linux kernel and Jailhouse Hypervisor for embedded, and Researching on the kernel/ring0 security and expanding my knowledge on it for further ring abstractions.
